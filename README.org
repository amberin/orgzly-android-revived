* Orgzly Revived

Orgzly is an outliner for taking notes and managing to-do lists. Orgzly Revived is a community-maintained version of Orgzly, as the development of the original app has been halted. The original Orgzly source code can be found
[[https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android][here]].

With Orgzly, you can keep notebooks stored in plain-text and have them synchronized
with a directory on your mobile device or an SD card, WebDAV server, or Dropbox.

Notebooks are saved in /Org mode/'s file format. “Org mode is for
keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and
authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.” See
http://orgmode.org for more information.

The Orgzly Revived project aims to continue development of the Orgzly application. The rebranding is due 
to the disappearance of the Orgzly author so we, as the community, had to come up with a new solution.
We plan to continue adding useful features, fixing bugs, keeping up-to-date with technological evolution, 
and generally maintaining the [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] outreach and its support on Android .Orgzly Revived is a community-maintained version of Orgzly, as the development of the original app is no longer active.

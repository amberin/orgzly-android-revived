* Orgzly Revived

Orgzly is an outliner for taking notes and managing to-do lists. Orgzly Revived is a community-maintained version of Orgzly, as the development of the original app has been halted. The original Orgzly source code can be found
[[https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android][here]].

With Orgzly, you can keep notebooks stored in plain-text and have them synchronized
with a directory on your mobile device or an SD card, WebDAV server, or Dropbox.

Notebooks are saved in /Org mode/'s file format. “Org mode is for
keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and
authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.” See
http://orgmode.org for more information.

The Orgzly Revived project aims to continue development of the Orgzly application. The rebranding is due to the disappearance of the Orgzly author so we, as the community, had to come up with a new solution. We plan to continue adding useful features, fixing bugs, keeping up-to-date with technological evolution, and generally maintaining the [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] outreach and its support on Android. Orgzly Revived is a community-maintained version of Orgzly, as the development of the original app is no longer active.

* Support 

- See the detailed [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/documentation][End-user documentation]]
- Ask your question in the [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived/discussions][Discussions]]
- There is also a Matrix chat room where anyone is welcome to join: [[https://matrix.to/#/#orgzly:matrix.org][#orgzly:matrix.org]].

* Verifying the APK signature

This is the SHA-256 checksum of our APK signing certificate, so that you can verify your downloaded APK using tools such as [[https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier][AppVerifier]] or [[https://developer.android.com/tools/apksigner][apksigner]]:

#+begin_quote
com.orgzlyrevived 6F:C9:C2:E2:2D:07:D2:5C:E7:7E:2E:96:34:55:05:3C:38:B8:31:8A:1A:24:91:B3:ED:95:D5:0C:BA:85:49:3D
#+end_quote

You should also check that this checksum matches the one published at [[https://orgzlyrevived.com/docs#verify-apk-signature][orgzlyrevived.com]].

Once you have installed the APK, Android should refuse to update the app to any new version which was not signed by the same private key.

* Building & testing

If you don't use Android Studio and wish to [[https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline.html][build]] and [[https://developer.android.com/studio/test/command-line.html][test]] the app from command line, the standard set of Gradle tasks is available. For example:

- ~./gradlew build~ builds the project and generates APK files
- ~./gradlew connectedAndroidTest~ runs instrumented unit tests

Make sure you [[https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/setup][turn off animations]] for the device you're testing on.

** Nix

If you are using Nix/NixOS, a flake with a =devShell= exists and can be used via [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]].

# TODO remove this when the issue is fixed and flake is bumped past the fix
Due to [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/402297][this nixpkgs issue]], you must run gradle like this:

#+begin_src shell
gradle $GRADLE_OPTS app:assembleDebug
#+end_src
